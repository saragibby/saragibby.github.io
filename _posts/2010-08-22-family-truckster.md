Dear Kids,

This year we have taken a record breaking 4 family road trips. All I have to say is&#8230; thank goodness for the DVD player in the car!

Our first 3 road trips were to Virginia to visit Grandpa and Grandma (or Bepa, and Mema according to Hunter). The 4th trip was this past weekend, a spur of the moment trip to Mackinac Island. After losing the newest Gibbons we decided we needed to get away and have some family time. And when I say &#8220;family time&#8221;, you should know this includes Shaun, Kristia & Paige. There is a saying, &#8220;Friends are the family we choose for ourselves.&#8221; Yup, we choose them&#8230; they&#8217;re family.

It was about a 10 hour drive down and a 10 hour drive back. All and all you guys did great. I also can&#8217;t tell you how many Scooby Doo movies we watched&#8230; listen, I said &#8220;10 hours&#8221;&#8230; you guys were at my mercy, I just couldn&#8217;t let you know that.

We went to downtown DC and walked our butts off. Little did we know that it was also Cherry Blossom Festival, and everyone else thought it was a good idea as well. Luckily, we had 5 adults and a stroller, so we could push our way through the crowds and no one got lost.

We had a bin hidden with the baskets in the back of the car, and reassured you (well, maybe just Brooklynn&#8230; Hunter was still pretty clueless about magical strangers who break into your house ad leave candy and gifts) that the bunny would know where we were at. We all had a great time and left already thinking about when we would be back.

July 4th weekend hit, and we jumped in the family truckster again headed down to DC for another visit with Grandpa and Grandma. Fireworks, pool, and family time. We didn&#8217;t do a lot of sight seeing this time around. We did go into downtown DC on July 4th to met my boss, Mike Doel (great guy), who happened to also be in DC with his family on vacation. I remember hotness, walking, sweating, hotness, walking&#8230; but your Dad and I did photo-bomb a live newscast on the July 4th parade we ran into which was cool.

Also while we were in Virginia over the 4th, Brooklynn lost one her bottom front teeth. Since you 2 were sleeping in a tent we weren&#8217;t quite sure how to handle the tooth fairy. Somehow we convinced you to save the tooth for when we got back home, and the fairy would know to come at home. Not sure how, but we pulled it off, and left you still believing&#8230; phew!

A few weeks later, over Hunter&#8217;s 3rd birthday weekend, we were headed to DC again. We got to celebrate Hunter&#8217;s birthday with Grandpa, Grandma and Aunt Debbie and explore more of Virginia. More family, and pool time, not much sight seeing, and Brooklynn came home with all her teeth.

Out of all our trips, our last trip to Mackinac was by far the best for the family. After we lost Baby Gibbons, your Dad and I knew we needed to get away as a family. So, of course that meant planing a trip with the Williamses&#8230; like I said, they&#8217;re family.

It was a time to enjoy family, and clear our heads. We were on the beach, and the weather was gorgeous! We shopped, had fudge (of course), ate lots of food, enjoyed time with Shaun, Kristia & Paige, and had campfire time on the beach. It was the best medicine for us. There is more heart healing to be done, but together we are well on our way to finding peace.
