9 years ago today your Dad and I got hitched. Ceremony, reception, white dress, tuxedos&#8230; the works. We had a small ceremony at the Rochester Hills Museum, and the reception at Dave & Busters (we were all about having fun, and plus thats where our first date was).

It rained that day, which I&#8217;m a little superstitious about so I was so glad it did. See, it has historically rained on most of the big days in my life&#8230; graduation, first job, wedding, each of your birthdays, and probably a bunch others I can&#8217;t remember, so I know good things are in the works for that day if it rains. I&#8217;m sure as you get older you will call me crazy for this, but I don&#8217;t care, rain translates into good luck&#8230;just embrace it.

We had great food, music, games, dancing, pool tables, and were surrounded by family and friends.

My wedding advice to you&#8230; do what you want. Get married on a beach, mountain, boat, have a huge party or just go to the courthouse. It&#8217;s your day. Throw the wedding rule books & guides out the window and make it just for you. I will support whatever you decide to do. But there is one thing&#8230; if you get married and don&#8217;t tell me&#8230; there will be hell to pay.

Also, I tell you that you can&#8217;t date or get married until you are 30. Until you are old enough to put it together that we have been married 9 years and are only 33, I&#8217;m absolutely not admitting to you that we got married before 30. You&#8217;ll have to earn that little nugget of info yourself.

Love &#8211; Mom
