Dear Kids,

Oh Christmas&#8230; what is their not to love about Christmas?! Family, friends, the spirit of giving, the magic of Santa, knowing I don&#8217;t have to cook and will be enjoying a buffet of Chinese take out&#8230; all great things!

But this year, after all we have been through, we knew it was time for change. We went to church on Sunday and they talked about a &#8220;Christmas Revolution&#8221;, flipping Christmas upside down. About giving instead of receiving. To decided how much money you were going to allocate to Christmas, and then decided of that how much can you do without.

They then passed out a booklet with 12 different ideas for giving, everything from helping communities in different countries, to helping Kensington families have a Christmas. For each translating the dollar donation to the impact on the community. It was amazing to see&#8230; that something like $50 to us could provide a community with rice for a month. Really makes you think about what we think we &#8220;need&#8221;.

For us, it was a no brainier that we wanted to give, and we immediately knew we wanted to help a Kensington family. We were actually able to adopt a Kensington family, to help give them a Christmas. The family was amazing! But even more amazing to me was the out pouring of support of friends and family who contributed with us for the family.

After losing the baby, it was the support of family and friends that made the difference. It truly touched me, and I still get choked up thinking about it. I now fully realize that support when you are in need, or at a down time in your life, means more then any tangible item, or dollar amount. Seeing that support again in our family and friends was amazing.

It was great to talk about with you two. Hunter kept asking me for a birthday cake on Christmas. I kept telling him, &#8220;No Hunter, nobody has a birthday on Christmas.&#8221; Then he would tell me that we need to sing Happy Birthday. Again, I would tell him, &#8220;Hunter buddy, no body has a birthday on Christmas.&#8221; Then finally one day he looked at me, &#8220;Mama, Christmas we sing &#8216;Happy Birthday to Jesus, Happy Birthday to you!'&#8221; It was the cutest, and yes I felt like an idiot for not catching on to that the first time. So, for the first year for our family we mad a birthday cake for Jesus, put one candle in it, sang Happy Birthday, and let you two blow out the candle. I called it my Jesus cake.

You two are at the best age to enjoy the magic of Santa. You love it all! And your Dad and I live it up. Your dad leaves cookie crumbs on the plate and in the milk. We buy special wrapping paper and bows to wrap Santa&#8217;s presents in, and secretly hide and throw away the scraps after we are done wrapping. It is a blast!

You guys were both going crazy to see Santa this year. We planned on taking you to see him at the mall like we did last year. But, ugh&#8230; it&#8217;s a mall. We buy anything we can online. Going to the mall has got to be a form on punishment on a normal day, but on Christmas?! Only for you guys would we do that. But luckily, one Sunday after church as went to our usual spot of Leo&#8217;s Coney Island, we saw this magical sign&#8230; &#8220;Dinner with Santa at Leos&#8221;. There mine as well been a light shining on it, I think I was more excited then you both. Cause I immediately knew, I don&#8217;t have to go to the mall. We marked it on the calendar, and were just after Santa arrived&#8230; no way we were missing it.

We made Santa cookies to take to Santa, you got to talk to Santa a bunch, he gave you each a wish list to fill out, and there happen to be a lady there taking pictures. It turned out to be a great night! You guys loved your Santa time, we got a great pic (thanks <a onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/out/makpics.com']);"  href="http://makpics.com">Kelly</a>!), no mall, no lines, great food, and the best part was it our family&#8217;s style. Did I mention there was no mall?

  Emotionally Christmas was difficult, cause it was about the time the baby was due. But we got a special ornament remembering the baby. Your dad got me an angel necklace, and Nana got me charm bracelet with one charm&#8230; an angel. You know which ones I&#8217;m talking about cause I&#8217;m guessing by the time you read this I will still be wearing both all the time.
