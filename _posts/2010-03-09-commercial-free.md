Dear Kids,

This may be hard to believe, but DVRs, Netflix, and DVD players haven&#8217;t been around forever. I grew up in a land of maybe 75 channels, VCRs, and having to sit through commercials if you wanted to watch a show.

First off, I&#8217;m not going to even bother explaining what a VCR is/was. You&#8217;ll just make fun of it. I know this cause it&#8217;s in your blood. Pretty sure that &#8220;smart-ass&#8221; is a gene, andÂ  you most definitely get it from both sides.

You press &#8220;Guide&#8221; on the remote and you can see what is on over 2000+ channels (all the 1000 channels of porn are blocked). I had to wait for the TV Guide in the Sunday paper to see what was on tv the coming week. There was no On-Demand, or streaming shows from the Internet. If you overlooked your show in that little book and missed it, you were screwed.

There was no fast-forwarding through commercials. If you wanted to watch a show you had to tolerate all commercials. You could do the &#8220;channel-flip&#8221;. That is, switch to a different channel to watch a brief second of tv, then back to see if your original show is back on, then flip to the other channel again&#8230; repeating until the commercials were over. Or, you could roll the dice and make a mad dash to the bathroom or kitchen. Trying to time it just right so you wouldn&#8217;t miss any of the show once the commercials were over. God forbid the phone rings during your show. There was no caller ID, so no way to know if answering the call would mean 2-seconds on the phone or completely missing your show.

You two get frustrated when the exact show you want to watch isn&#8217;t on, and you can&#8217;t stand commercials. As we were watching tv tonight a commercial came on. You both looked at me. I hesitated and got a, &#8220;Mom commercials.&#8221; I said, &#8220;It&#8217;s live tv.&#8221; Hunter thought the show was over and pulled out a DVD. B said, &#8220;Can&#8217;t we watch something on the DVR?&#8221;

On the tip of my tongue was, &#8220;When I was your age&#8230;&#8221; I somehow managed to stop myself. Then had a flash of, &#8220;omg, they are totally going to use this as ammo about how old I am.&#8221;

Until then, I need to use this to my advantage. So&#8230; I&#8217;ve decided to do away with time-outs. New punishment, sit on the couch and watch one entire set of commercials. I think this could work.

Love &#8211; Mom
