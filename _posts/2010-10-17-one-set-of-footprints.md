Dear Kids,

It&#8217;s been a little over two months since we lost the baby. It has been the most emotional, life changing two months of my life. It is clear to me now that after a loss you have one basic decision to make&#8230; are you going to curl up and submit to the sadness, or stand up let the sun in and say, &#8216;from this point on I am a new person&#8217;. It doesn&#8217;t mean you aren&#8217;t sad, or don&#8217;t have sad times. It means you also take the time to discover the new you, and look forward.

The part I haven&#8217;t shared with you about the day I had my surgery, was the half hour I spent in pre-surgery by myself. No nurses, your Dad wasn&#8217;t allowed back yet&#8230; it was just me.

I was emotionally drained. The list of possible complications from the surgery was too much for me to comprehend. I&#8217;ve never had surgery and here I was about to go under full anesthesia, going to be intubated&#8230; all I could do was pray. I didn&#8217;t ask God for a perfect surgery&#8230; I asked him to carry me. I told Him it was too much for me to bear. I couldn&#8217;t do it any more. I only asked to get me out on the other side healthy and there for my kids.

After the surgery was over and the doctor told me all went perfectly, I felt this wave of peace come over me. I got what I prayed for. I was healthy and would be going home soon to my kids. It was truly a point in my life where there will be one set of footprints in the sand.

I can&#8217;t look at the &#8216;whys&#8217; of losing the baby. I think after a loss the &#8216;whys&#8217; could drive you crazy, and will get you no where. I look at the fact that I was at my weakest moment, and asked God to get me healthy and home to my kids and I got that.

Losing the baby was the most spiritual thing I have ever been through. As terrible as it was, it has changed your Dad and I forever&#8230; in a way nothing else would have done. We found a church we love (<a onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/out/kensingtonchurch.org/']);" title="Kensington Church"  href="http://kensingtonchurch.org/" target="_blank">Kensington</a>), we pray, and have faith in the path that God has laid out for us.

After a loss, some people will think you&#8217;re not &#8216;over it&#8217; fast enough. Or that you got &#8216;over it&#8217; too quickly. The fact of the matter is, is that you are never &#8216;over it&#8217;&#8230; you find peace with it. And however long it takes you is different for every person. You stand up, you look forward, believe in the path God has for you, and let it change you in a positive way.

I chose to stand up.

Love &#8211; Mom
