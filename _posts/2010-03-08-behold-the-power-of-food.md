Dear Hunter,

Since day one you have LOVED your food. It started with bottle, when you would see it you would immediately get happy and all smiles. It was cute. Once you could eat food you would scream at me when you were hungry until I got your food. One of my favorite series of pictures of you is when you first had cereal&#8230;

You screamed while I was trying to mix your cereal, but you had no hesitation once you got a taste. Next thing I know you got so excited I couldn&#8217;t shovel it in fast enough&#8230;

This same smile and excitement about food has continued. If a meal is late you don&#8217;t hesitate to let me know every second that you wait. If I won&#8217;t let you have the snack you want&#8230; look out! You will throw a fit until I found an acceptable alternative snack.

Now that you are over 2 1/2 we are really trying to encourage the potty training (that&#8217;s another letter in itself). The problem is you are too smart, and realize that shitting in your pants and having someone wipe your ass is much easier the trying to hold it and go in the potty. With no incentive for you, you just aren&#8217;t interested.

This weekend we hit a winner of an idea. If you pee or poop on the potty you get a cookie. It is totally working! I will see you run to the potty, leaving a trail of socks, pants, diaper&#8230; then a minute later you come out naked screaming &#8220;COOKIE!!!&#8221;Â  It&#8217;s a struggle to get you to wash your hands before your cookie, but we somehow manage.

I&#8217;m not sure how we will wean you off the pee for a cookie plan, but as long as it gets you shitting in the toilet I have no plans on stopping. You enjoy a good/stinky poop&#8230; me, not so much.

Love &#8211; Mom
