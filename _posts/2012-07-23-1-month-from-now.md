Dear Kids,

1 month from now&#8230; we will be getting ready to welcome your new little brother into the world. His name has yet to be picked (we like to wait to see you each before we make the final decision), but is already tipping the scales at 5lbs 3oz at my 33 week ultrasound today.

It&#8217;s been a long, emotional road to get to this point. It was a surprise when we learned that I was pregnant again. After we lost the last baby, I had a mindset that we were destin to be a family of four. No more planning our life around a family expansion. This was the way God intended our family to be, and we were going to embrace it.

For me personally, I started running. Now, let me tell you. No matter what I say to you, and teach you, running is the worst. I&#8217;ve never liked it. But, I was determined to get in shape. I needed a goal, and decided to start planning to run a 5K in the spring of 2012. In my world, running a 5K mine as well be traveling to the moon. I knew I could do it though. I needed to do it. Therapy for me, and in a way remembrance for the babies. We&#8217;ve lost them, I&#8217;ve come out on the other side of the surgeries with no problems&#8230; I&#8217;ve already survived what seemed emotionally impossible in my mind&#8230; so, what could be physically possible for me that seems impossible?

I started the Couch 2 5k program, and all was off to a good start. And by December I had completed 2 months of it (going at my own pace) without vomit or death, so I considered it a complete success. By Christmas I wasn&#8217;t feeling so great. In the pit of my stomach, I knew what the feeling was. After being through the first timester of pregnancy 2 times back to back, it was fresh in my mind. But, I was to scared to admit it or speak word of it. By New Years Eve, tests all said positive. I cried.

Why was God taking me down this road again? How would I be able to survive the pain? I was certain all would go just as the last 2 went&#8230;facing a doctor&#8217;s appointment with no heartbeat, and off to surgery. I prayed. I asked God that if he was going to take the baby to please take it now&#8230;that I could not bear losing another.

My first doctor&#8217;s appointment came, and they sent me for an early ultrasound. Turned out there was a pocket of blood by the baby. They said it was common, it usually goes away, and put me on a limited activity, with no lifting. I thought, this is it&#8230;that I knew how this story was going to play out.

I didn&#8217;t want to tell anyone I was pregnant. In fact, I didn&#8217;t want to talk about it at all with even your Dad. Kind of like the first 2 rules of Fight Club (yes, by the time you read this it will be &#8216;old&#8217; movie&#8230;watch it), &#8220;You do not talk about Fight Club.&#8221; The pain of losing a baby is extreme. The pain of having to tell other people, to see the look on their face, hear their sadness&#8230;I just wasn&#8217;t ready for that again.

The doctors began monitoring me weekly, watching the pocket of blood. I think I cried every week. Soon, weeks went by and the first trimester was in the books. The pocket of blood was still there, and I was approaching the 18 week mark. The point where I lost the other 2. I was a mess. I went into the big growth ultrasound at 18.5 weeks&#8230;my heart was racing a mile a minute. I asked them to check the heart right away as I laid down for the ultrasound. There it was, pumping away. I&#8217;m pretty sure tears shot out. Later they tell me the pocket of blood was gone. I felt like it was a miracle. That God was watching over the baby. It was a point I never thought I would be at again.

Before I knew it, I was 24 weeks. Which meant the baby now had a chance to survive outside the womb. In the weeks leading up to this point, I thought, &#8220;oh when I get to 24 weeks I will tell people.&#8221; Yeah, that didn&#8217;t happen. I was filled with anxiety at the thought of telling anyone. My doctor was great. She said, &#8220;There is no reason you need to tell people, or make a big announcement. Just go with it. Be comfortable, and let it happen.&#8221;

The doctors have monitored me weekly this entire time, with a monthly ultrasound. The high-risk doctor I was seeing even classified me as a &#8220;normal pregnancy&#8221;. I&#8217;m now in the home stretch. It feels surreal to be at this point. I feel so blessed that the baby is growing great, and healthy.

We still have no answers, no reasons, why we lost the last two babies. Maybe there is a special purpose for your soon to be little brother. Maybe you both needed more time with your Dad and I before there was another sibling. It&#8217;s amazing though that after we lost the last baby I thought, &#8220;If God&#8217;s will is for us to have a baby, it is in His hands.&#8221; I completely surrendered to His will. Before we knew it, surprise! The baby is due right as school starts, and Hunter will be in full-day kindergarten. We can&#8217;t even plan dinner that well.

We don&#8217;t have anything ready for your little brother yet. I think your Dad and I are both still in a little bit of denial. We figure worst case scenario we will me making an Amazon Prime order from the hospital. Your great-grandma always said your grandma slept in a dresser drawer when she came home from the hospital, so I figure it will all work out. Besides, we will all be so thrilled to have him here I don&#8217;t think any of us will want to let him go. <img src="http://saragibby.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
