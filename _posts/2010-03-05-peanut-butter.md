Dear Kids,

With so many nut allergies out there, it seems almost taboo to give you peanut butter. But you two love it! Whenever we try to mix it up with a different kind of sandwich you&#8217;ll find some reason not to eat it and then ask for a plain ole peanut butter sandwich.

God forbid any honey or jelly find it&#8217;s way into the peanut butter sandwich. Both of you will look at us in disgust as if we just served you a bowl of steamed brussel sprouts.

Now, as you get older you should now that eating peanut butter from the jar isn&#8217;t acceptable in a setting outside of family. Yes, I know you sometimes use a spoon, but you do what is called &#8216;double dipping&#8217;. That means you dip the spoon in for peanut butter, lick every last bit of it off and take the same slobbery spoon in for round 2.

Also, despite you trying to hide it, I know those little fingers go diving into the peanut butter jar when I&#8217;m not looking. I tell you I have eyes in the back of my head, but really, the smell of peanut butter on your fingers is a dead give away. I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll learn when you get older that a little wash of the hands would cover it up, but for now&#8230; it&#8217;s my secret weapon.

Love &#8211; Mom
