Dear Kids,

This weekend marks the first few days of a better year&#8230; what damn well better be a better year. Let&#8217;s face it, 2010 was pretty sucky&#8230; it&#8217;s only up from here. So, to kick this year off right I thought I&#8217;d take a look back at the past few months at all the great times we have had together, and start planning some new family adventures.

<a onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/download/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/IMG_1802.jpg']);"  href="http://saragibby.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/IMG_1802.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-140 alignleft" title="IMG_1802" src="http://saragibby.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/IMG_1802-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="135" height="201" /></a>This fall was all about family. Whenever we could we were at a cider mill, making costumes, eating something with pumpkin in it, we had some great times together. The pumpkin carving&#8230; well, lesson learned there. If you are going to gut the pumpkins and wait to carve them until a couple days later, you need to put them outside. If you leave them inside&#8230; just trust me, put them outside.

As far as costumes, Brooklynn first started off with &#8220;Scary Cheerleader&#8221;. Which I was kind of okay with, but then you brought up Cowgirl, so we latched onto that and ran with it. Hunter didn&#8217;t seem to care too much. If you asked him what he wanted to be for Halloween, he either said something different every time, or said car. In the end we went with a dinosaur/dragon. The pattern for the costume was a dragon, but we told you dinosaur&#8230; you were going through a dinosaur phase.

It was a bunch of late nights sewing, but I loved every minute of it! Don&#8217;t worry I saved them for you. I don&#8217;t know what you will do with them, but my mom saved all my stuff for me, so it&#8217;s just what moms do.

We also upped the anti this year on Halloween and went to <a onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/out/www.thehenryford.org/events/halloweenEvent.aspx']);"  href="http://www.thehenryford.org/events/halloweenEvent.aspx">Greenfield Village</a>, and <a onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/out/www.geneseecountyparks.org/pages/huckleberry']);"  href="http://www.geneseecountyparks.org/pages/huckleberry">Huckelberry Railroad</a>. Huckelberry Railroad was perfect for your age! We got a train ride, sing Halloween songs, find 20 trick-or-treat stations, and it all ended with cider and doughnuts. We all loved it, and it will definitely be a repeat for next. year.

We spent most of the time to keep you guys from being scared. All was lost though when the grim reaper pointed it&#8217;s finger and walked towards me while I was taking it&#8217;s picture. We&#8217;ll just put that on that &#8220;Try that again in 5 years list.&#8221;

Of course, as we close up our look back on fall we can&#8217;t forget about our lil B getting one year older. You wanted a gymnastics party for all your friends. We could only invite 12 kids. You had a list of 20 kids, so I helped you narrow it down. I guess a couple of them asked you why they didn&#8217;t get invited. You told me your response was, &#8220;Well, you should have been nicer to me.&#8221; Haha! Out of the mouth of babes! <a onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/download/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/IMG_2190.jpg']);"  href="http://saragibby.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/IMG_2190.jpg"></a>
