Dear Kids,

This is by far the hardest letter I have written to you to date. But I need to&#8230; not only to explain to you what happened, but to help begin to heal myself.

For the past couple months we have been preparing you for a little brother or sister expected on New Year&#8217;s Eve. At a routine doctor&#8217;s checkup this past Tuesday that all changed. We got the worst possible news&#8230; no heartbeat.

The doctor was going to call your Dad for me, but I knew the news had to come from me. We were both devastated. I felt like I was in a bad dream. Here I was 18 weeks pregnant&#8230; how could this happen? All I could do was wait for your Dad to get there and get instructions on what to do next from the doctor.

The doctor said I had 2 options&#8230; labor and delivery or have a surgical procedure. I knew that going through labor would be the most difficult option, but it was the safest. I had no idea what would be involved, what to expect, all I felt was sadness&#8230; and I longed to have you both cuddled up next to me.

We got to the hospital as quick as we could to get the process started. After 2 days of being in the hospital under heavy medications, no food, no sleep&#8230; we continued to wait. The doctor came in and told us I had been receiving four-times the normal about of the medication normally used to induce labor and we were getting no where. Our options were then, continue on at the hospital with the medication&#8230; risk being, the continued medication could cause internal issues and possible surgery.Â  Or we could schedule the surgical procedure we were first offered. This came with it&#8217;s own risks, but we could discontinue the dangerous dose of medication I was receiving, and go home until the procedure.

I was an emotional mess. I haven&#8217;t seen either of you in 2 days. I hadn&#8217;t eaten in 2 days. I opted to schedule the surgical procedure and go home. My nurse at the hospital, Heather, was amazing! She promised a bagel and a plate of bacon as soon as I was done. When I opted to be released she warmed up a plate full of bacon, got me a bagel, and a huge hug. She helped your Dad and I through the toughest thing we have ever been through. She sat and talked with us about what would happen with the baby after it was born, she lightened the mood with jokes, and just spent time getting to know us.

It is amazing how people come into your life by chance and forever change you. Heather told me, &#8220;This will always be a part of you. It will not define you.&#8221; She will forever hold a special place inside my heart.

Thursday afternoon we had a doctor&#8217;s appointment with the specialist who would perform my surgery. He got me prepared for the surgery, and we scheduled it for first thing Friday morning. Up until then I have never been under anesthesia, had surgery, or being in the hospital other then when I had you too. I was scared, nervous, and sad.

Friday morning came and we were off to the hospital. By 11am I was in recovery and back with your Dad. All went just as the doctor expected with no complications. By noon I was on my way home.

Your Dad was amazing. He is my rock, and I have never loved him more. He was by my side through it all, and getting me anything I needed. He knew when to hold me and give me tissues, and when to put in &#8220;Hangover&#8221; to cheer me up.

One of the hardest things was telling Brooklynn. Hunter is still too young to really understand there was a baby on the way, but my Lil B was already practicing on her babies. We sat you down B to talk to you&#8230; we told you that the baby was gone, and we would have no baby this year. As you sat on my lap as I cried you turned to me and said, &#8220;It&#8217;s ok Mom. I love you. Maybe we&#8217;ll have a baby next year.&#8221; And gave me a big hug. You then handed me tissues, and asked me what I needed. It was the sweetest thing.

The support we have/are receiving from family, friends and co-workers is overwhelming. Flowers, plants, cards, email, calls, even text messages&#8230; I never realized how much love we were surrounded with. It filled my heart more then I can explain. All I had to do was read who the message was from and the tears started again.

This has forever changed me. The stuff that seemed so important just a week ago now seems trivial. All I want to do is be with the two of you, and spend time with family and friends. That&#8217;s what is important.

I know I will be sad for awhile. But the more tears I cry, the more people I talk to the better I start to feel. Surprisingly spending 2 days in the hospital was good for your Dad and I. It gave us a chance to be alone&#8230; to talk, to cry, to grieve.

As I laid in the hospital one night, unable to sleep and watching dumb reality tv, I kept seeing this itty-bitty moth in the bathroom. I remember thinking, &#8220;What the heck? How did this little moth get into this hospital room?&#8221; Shortly after that I all of a sudden thought of your Dad&#8217;s grandpa. I have never met him, but I always hear about him and what a wonderful person he was. I guess he always used to sing and make up songs&#8230; you 2 do the exact same thing. So I know he already lives on in both of you. As he came to mind about 4am this thought came over me&#8230; that it&#8217;s okay&#8230; the baby is with him, and he will take care of it until we can. I all of a sudden felt some peace about it all, and I never saw the tiny moth again.

We will probably never know why this all happened. All we can do is believe in God, and know that despite all this pain there is reasons beyond us that exist. Some day we will meet our little angel. Until then he or she will live with us everyday in our hearts.

Love &#8211; Mom
